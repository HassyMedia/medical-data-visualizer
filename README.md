# medical-data-visualizer

## Overview
This project is focused on visualizing and analyzing medical examination data. It uses Python along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore relationships between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

## Data Description
The dataset represents patients' medical examination data, including body measurements, blood test results, and lifestyle choices.

## Key Features
- Calculation of BMI and categorization of overweight individuals.
- Normalization of cholesterol and glucose levels.
- Visualization of medical data in categorical plots and heatmaps.
- Data cleaning to remove implausible values.

## Visualization
- Categorical plots to show the counts of medical attributes split by the presence of cardiac disease.
- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between different medical attributes.

## How to Run
Ensure Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are installed. Run `medical_data_visualizer.py` to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
